# Star Tracker

An Android and IOS app to wirelessly control an Arduino (ESP8266).
The app is completely written in Dart to make it cross-platform compatible.
You can control following things:
- Status (on/off)
- Speed
- Direction of the motor

# Notice

- The app is still under development and not complete.
- The current language is Dutch.
- It's also my first app I've ever programmed so it's far from perfect.


# Features that need to be added

- App icon
- Timer
- Weather data
- About screen / FAQ


# Bugs / problems

- Text in reset FAB doesn't stay white when enabling dark mode
- APK needs to be signed.
