# Star Tracker
An Android and IOS app to wirelessly control an Arduino (ESP8266).
The app is completely written in Dart to make it cross-platform compatible.
You can control following things:
- Status (on/off)
- Speed
- Direction of the motor
You can also see the weather data (from GPS location) to know if the sky is clear (to take photos) and if it will rain or not.

# Notice

- The app is still under development and not complete.
- The current language is Dutch.
- It's also my first app I've ever programmed so it's far from perfect.

# Bugs / problems
