# Star Tracker
![Home](/screenshot/iPhone.png?raw=true)

An Android and IOS app to wirelessly control an Arduino (ESP8266).
The app is completely written in Dart to make it cross-platform compatible.
You can control following things:
- Status (on/off)
- Speed
- Direction of the motor

# Notice

- The app is still under development and not complete.
- The current language is Dutch.
- It's also my first app I've ever programmed so it's far from perfect.


# Features that need to be added

- App icon
- Weather data


# Bugs / problems

- APK needs to be signed.
