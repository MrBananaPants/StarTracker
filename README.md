# Star Tracker

An Android and IOS app to wirelessly control an Arduino (ESP8266).
The app is completely written in Dart to make it cross-platform compatible.
You can control following things:
- Status (on/off)
- Speed
- Direction of the motor

# Notice

- The app is still under development and not complete.
- The current language is Dutch.
- It's also my first app I've ever programmed so it's far from perfect.

# Bugs / problems

What needs to be added / fixed:

- Timer should be added to show the user how long the Star Tracker has been running for.
- App icons need to be made.
- APK needs to be signed.
